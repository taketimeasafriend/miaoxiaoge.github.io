      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is a book for my first lesson in English study.There are some good sentences below: Day-1And by “willpower”,I mean some innate quality of inner strength that allows those who have it to successfully avoid temptation.1234[v]allowallow somebody to do something[v]avoidavoid something/doing something Most people believe that it’s fundamentally a character issue.Some people have willpower(the thin,nonsmokers-and we admire them for it).Others don’t,and we judge them accordingly.123[n]a character issue[v]admire[v]judge Willpower is not what you think it is.1[n]willpower Self-control is the ability to guide your actions in pursuit of a goal-to persevere and stay on course,despite temptations,distractions,and the demands of competing goals.12[v]guide[v]persevere Everyone knows that eating less and exercising more will help you lose weight.But knowing is one thing,and actually doing it is another thing entirely.12[v]exercise[v]lose weight His meteoric rise from community orgnizer to Harvard Law Review president,state senator,U.S. sennator,and finally president of the United States would be worthy of admiration were he the son of well-connected New England blue bloods.12[n]meteoric rise[n]blue bloods But he isn’t-he is the mixed-race child of a broken home and a family of average means,with no particular advantages other than his clearly extraordinary intelligence and determination.123[n]average means[n]intelligence[n]determination Day-2Like a muscle,self-control can very in its strength-not only from person to person,but from moment to moment.123[v]varyvariousvariety People who are very successful in one or more areas of their life are successful precisely because that’s where they devote the bulk of their capacity for self-control.12[v]devote[n]capacity When you tax it too much,the well of self-control will certainly run dry.12[v]tax[v]run Depletion is only temporary,and you are most vulnerable immediately after you’ve used up your self-control reserves.1234[n]depletion[adj]temporary[adj]vulnerable[v]use up “Increasing your motivation through better rewards can help you compensate for a temporary loss of self-control”1234[n]reward[v]compensatecompensate for something[n]loss Another way in which willpower,or self-control,is different than you may have imagined is that it’s neither innate nor unchangeable.Self-control is learned,and developed and made strong(or weaker)over time.123[adj]innate[adj]unchangeable[v]develop Succeed is about understanding how goals work,what tends to go wrong,and what you can do to reach your goals ro to help others reach theirs.12[v]work[v]tend to do something Day-3The first step to getting anywhere is to deside where you want to go.123[v]get[v]decidedecide to do something Without being translated into goals,our desires remain just that-things we wish would happen.12[v]translate[v]remain Succee is more likely when you focus on the right details,in the right way.12[v]focus on[n]detail In the absence of a specific goal,do your best somewhat ironically tends to produce work that is far from the best-it’s a recipe for mediocrity.1234[adj]specific[v]produce[n]recipe[n]mediocrity The alternative is to set specific,difficult goals.Difficult but possible is the key.123[n]alternative[v]set[n]key Succeeding at something hard is more pleasurable,gives great satisfaction and happiness,and increases your overall sense of well-being.123[adj]pleasurable[n]satisfactionsense of well-being Setting specific,challengling goals creates a cycle of success and happiness that can repeat itself over and over again,creating the “high performance cycle”.123[v]repeat[v]createhigh performance cycle]]></content>
